/*

YOU WILL NEED TO CODE THE eval, substitute, AND deepCopy METHODS OF THIS CLASS.
These are all defined recursively on the CFExp and don't require a lot of code.


For the CofinFin expressions with binary operators.  There are four

union U
intersection @
set difference \
symmetric difference (+)

we will code them in the operator data member by their token ids

The constructors here and elsewhere tests the input so that only valid operators and
expressions can be created.

   evaluate the left subexpression before the right subexpression
